For this assignment, I have used some segments of code from Assignment 2 & 3 and turned them into a header file linkedList.h
I have also included a second cpp file (linkedList.cpp) that provides the code for the functions that are being used in a4

Functions that I have implemented myself:
- compareList(linkedList, linkedList)
- findLargest()
- removeNode(int)
- findNum(int)

The other functions that have been used are functions from Assignment 2 & 3 with slight modifications 

How the program works:
- The program reads the text file and inserts it into 2 seperate lists.
- Checks if list 1 is empty, if so, returns "None"
- Checks if list 2 is empty, if so, returns largest number in list 1.
- If neither is empty, program runs the function compareList(list1, list2)
- Using a while loop, I retrieve the largest number in list 1 with the function findLargest(). After finding the largest number, I check
if it exists in list 2. If the largest number in list 1 is also in list 2, I delete the largest number from list 1 and get the next largest
number.
- Once the largest number in list 1 that is not in list 2 is found or list 1 is empty, the program returns the largest number or "None" 
accordingly.
